# üß© Knight Game Puzzle - Inspired by *The Lonely Knight*

This project is a C# implementation of a chess-based puzzle inspired by [The Lonely Knight](https://plastelina.net/the-lonely-knight/). The idea is to find all valid knight's tours that start and end at the same square, visiting each open cell exactly once.

## ‚ôüÔ∏è Puzzle Description

You are given a grid of `n x m` containing:

- `'0'`: a square the knight can move to
- `'*'`: a blocked square the knight cannot enter

A knight starts at a square marked `'0'` and must:

1. Visit every `'0'` exactly once
2. Return to the starting square
3. Never land on a `'*'`

This project finds **all such valid closed tours**.
